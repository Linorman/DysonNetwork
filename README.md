# The Dyson Network

The Dyson Network is the software behind the Solar Network.
We open sourced it here to make everything transparent and open for everyone.

But it is not designed for self-hosted due to multiple reasons.

Still, you can deploy it on your own infrastructure.
But we will not providing any support for that.

Besides, according to the APGL v3 license,
if you host a modified version of the software,
you must open-source it under the same license.

## Documentation

Although we're not support to self-host the software,
but we're still welcome for developers to build software on top of this.

Check out the OpenAPI Documentation at any instance /swagger path.
