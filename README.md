# The Dyson Network

The Dyson Network is the software behind the Solar Network.
We open sourced it here to make everything transparent and open for everyone.

But it is not designed for self-hosted due to multiple reasons.

1. Branding everywhere: The variables, classes and functions name are just defined to serve the Solar Network. I think you're not hope to see the Solar Network related branding on your own server.
2. Hard coded URLs: Some services might use other Solsynth LLC's services which the URL is hard coded into the code and there is no alternative to it. Which means your server need stay connected with our services and the Internet.
3. No documentation: The documentation is not available for self-hosted or guide to deploy it on your local machine.
4. No support: We don't provide any support for self-hosted.

Still, you can deploy it on your own infrastructure if you want, we didn't disallow it.

Besides, according to the APGL v3 license,
if you host a modified version of the software,
you must open-source it under the same license.

## Documentation

Although we're not support to self-host the software,
but we're still welcome for developers to build software on top of this.
